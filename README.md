# Movie Data Analysis Project

This project explores movie-related datasets using **statistical analysis**, **hypothesis testing**, and **data visualization** techniques. The goal is to discover patterns and validate assumptions about factors that may influence movie success such as **budget, genre, runtime, revenue**, and **audience ratings**.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of Data Mining module at SIIT, Thammasat University. We focused on answering key questions about movies using real-world data. The project includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Formulation of hypotheses
* Statistical validation using plots and tests
* Visualization of insights with matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas

---

## Data Source

The dataset includes metadata on a wide range of movies and covers attributes such as:

* Movie title
* Genre
* Release year
* Runtime
* Metascore
* Ratings
* Gross

---

## Data Preprocessing and Statistical Analysis

The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and removing outliers. Basic summary statistics were computed to understand the distribution of key variables. Visual tools like histograms and box plots were used to inspect data quality and prepare for hypothesis testing.

---

## Hypotheses

The project tests several hypotheses, including:

1. **Are Movie Ratings Shaped by Genre Preferences?**
2. **Investigating whether the choice of movie genre significantly influences yearly gross revenue trends in the film industry**

Each hypothesis is supported with:

* Statistical Data Distribution
* Visual analysis
* Statistical interpretation

---

## Tools and Libraries

This project was implemented using:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy


---

## Key Visualizations

* Genre Word Cloud
* Genre Popularity Over time
* Genre-based distribution within last fice decades
